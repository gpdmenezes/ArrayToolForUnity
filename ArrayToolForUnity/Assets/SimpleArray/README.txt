# Simple Array for Unity

**Simple Array** is a versatile and user-friendly C# tool for Unity that empowers developers to create arrays of objects and prefabs with ease. With features like offset customization, randomization, and support for multidimensional arrays, it simplifies the process of arranging and manipulating GameObjects in your scenes.

## Features

- **Array Creation:** Quickly create arrays of objects and prefabs in your Unity scenes.
- **Offset Customization:** Fine-tune the positioning of each element in the array with customizable offsets.
- **Randomization:** Add variety to your arrays by applying random offsets, rotations, and scales.
- **Multidimensional Arrays:** Stack array scripts on top of each other to create multidimensional arrays for complex scene arrangements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the latest release.
2. Copy the `SimpleArray` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` directory.
3. Attach the `SimpleArray` script to your GameObject.
4. Customize the array properties in the Inspector to suit your needs.

## Usage

1. **Array Creation:**
    - Attach the `SimpleArray` script to a GameObject.
    - Specify the base object or prefab you want to duplicate.
    - Adjust the array dimensions and size.

2. **Offset Customization:**
    - Fine-tune the positioning of each element using X, Y, and Z offsets.
    - Achieve precise layouts by adjusting offset values.

3. **Randomization:**
    - Enable randomization for offset, rotation, and scale.
    - Add variety to your scene by introducing controlled randomness.

4. **Multidimensional Arrays:**
    - Stack multiple instances of the `SimpleArray` script to create multidimensional arrays.
    - Combine arrays for more complex and intricate scene setups.
